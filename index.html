  <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
  <main>
    <p>
      The duo is composed of Kevin and his brother Henry. They were respectively born on November 8, 1991 and
      February 6, 1996 in the 3rd district of Paris to a Chinese-Vietnamese father and a Chinese-Belgian mother.
      Kevin attended the Lycée Louis-le-Grand, then the Lycée Saint-Louis, and graduated from Télécom SudParis in
      2016. Henry entered ESSEC in July 2017 after studying in preparatory classes at Intégrale.
      The first Rire Jaune video was published on November 26, 2012 on the YouTube platform. Initially, only Kevin
      was making skits on YouTube with the slogan "Because an Asiat' who doesn't use an accent can still make you
      laugh".
      <br><br>
      Henry began helping him with writing and filming, then appeared in some videos, until February 2014, when he
      posted his first solo video, "Being 18."
      At the Web Comedy Awards in 2014, Le Rire Jaune won the Orangina Revelation award.
      The channel has nearly 5 million subscribers as of November 2019, making it the 11th largest French YouTube
      channel in terms of subscribers.
      <br><br>
      In 2015, Kevin opened a second YouTube channel called Le Show Jaune, where he presents viral video
      commentaries. The videos from Le Show Jaune have now been moved to the main channel.
      <br><br>
      The duo is, among other things, named among the most influential people of Gen Z by Elle magazine.
      Their video Les Grandes Écoles was the ninth most viewed French video excluding music videos on YouTube in
      2015.
      <br><br>
      In 2016, Kevin played the character Zed in the film adaptation of Ratchet and Clank.
      <br><br>
      Kevin was interviewed on the show Good Morning Cefran on Le Mouv' and invited on the show Guillaume Radio
      2.0 on NRJ.
      <br><br>
      Kevin Tran also published in 2016 a manga entitled Ki et Hi, narrating the lives of two brothers, inspired by
      his brotherhood with Henry.
      The drawings were done by Fanny Antigny, a subscriber noticed by Kevin after a fan-ar she had offered him.
      This manga was a big success in bookstores.
      On January 15, 2021, Henry Tran announced that he would no longer make videos on the Rire Jaune channel.
      This concludes their separation.
      <br><br>
      On January 31, 2021, Kevin announces that the YouTube channel will become an English channel. He renamed it
      Kevin Tran.
      <br><br>
      His first English video is called "Dear Kobe" in tribute to the basketball star, Kobe bryant who died in January
      2020.
